# Package Description : 
Python package for TOPSIS(The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) ALGORITHM.  
# Motivation :   
This is a part of project - I made for UCS633 - Data analytics and visualization at TIET.
# Algorithm :    
### STEP 1 :    
Create an evaluation matrix consisting of m alternatives and n criteria, with the intersection of each alternative and criteria.

### STEP 2 :   
The matrix is then normalised using the norm.

### STEP 3 : 
Calculate the weighted normalised decision matrix.

### STEP 4 : 
Determine the worst alternative and the best alternative.

### STEP 5 :
Calculate the L2-distance between the target alternative i and the worst condition.

### STEP 6 : 
Calculate the similarity to the worst condition.

### STEP 7 : 
Rank the alternatives according to final performance scores.
